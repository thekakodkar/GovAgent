## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-07
### "Sovereign Supply Chain & Enterprise Mesh" Release

### ⚓ Added: Phase 4 - Harbor Cryptographic OCI Tool Gating
- **Stage 5 Container Gating:** Enhanced the tool ingestion layer to validate execution tools against an enterprise Harbor Registry before instantiation.
- **Cryptographic Signature Verification:** Implemented the `HarborVerifier` utility to evaluate Cosign/Notation sign-offs and verify zero-tolerance multi-tenant vulnerability metrics natively out-of-band.
- **Supply-Chain Schema Expansion:** Appended optional `oci_repository` and `artifact_digest` attributes to the `ToolManifest` Pydantic layout without breaking legacy `v0.6.0` initialization configurations.
- **Registry Interception Hook:** Integrated a strict `GlobalRegistry.verify_and_resolve_tool` circuit breaker that automatically halts agent workflows and drops permissions on contaminated or unsigned container images.

### 🏢 Added: Phase 3 - IBM Bob MCP Proxy & watsonx Telemetry Busses
- **Token-Free Out-of-Band Middleware:** Engineered the `BobMCPProxyGateway` as an inline asynchronous wrapper (`govern_mcp_tool`) to protect Model Context Protocol local tool boundaries with zero cloud token or external API key dependencies.
- **Localized Semantic Evaluation:** Configured proxy routing to use memory-isolated `sentence-transformers` models to execute local CPU/GPU similarity comparisons (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) inside localized RAM spaces.
- **watsonx Orchestrate Cost Tracking:** Built the `watsonx_bus` tracking layer to map financial generation metrics and calculate recursive expenditure thresholds on active enterprise pipelines.
- **Full-Stack Presentation Synchronization:** Upgraded `api/server.py` volatile memory tracking registries and the Next.js `src/app/page.tsx` Live Audit Matrix interface to render real-time Orchestrator Bus types, Harbor cryptographic digest strings (`SHA`), and live compliance statuses simultaneously.

- **Dynamic Optimization Profiling:** Implemented policy metadata parameter scanning (`routing_mode`, `default_provider`) to allow real-time selection between local SLMs or cloud services depending on data risk profiles[cite: 11].

### 📡 Added: Cross-Swarm Context Trace Inheritance
- **Async Thread Propagation:** Refactored execution isolation to leverage thread-safe tokens via `set_current_agent` and `reset_current_agent` hooks[cite: 11].
- **Continuous Lineage Auditing:** Configured automated trace propagation so child sub-agents implicitly inherit and validate master anchor trace identifiers (`parent_trace_id`), providing a bulletproof audit trail for Article 12 compliance[cite: 11].

### 🛡️ Fixed: Windows Character Mapping & Payload Parsing
- **UTF-8 I/O Boundary Safety Net:** Patched file opening streams across `Policy.from_yaml` and `MetaGovernor.analyze_friction` to explicitly use `encoding="utf-8"`, permanently solving `UnicodeDecodeError` failures caused by legacy Windows system decoder defaults (`cp1252`)[cite: 11].
- **Telemetry Parameter Flattening:** Refactored model tracking fields inside `ExecutionSnapshot` to resolve metrics using safe dictionary bracket indexing (`.get("recursive_tco_usd")`), eliminating unhandled dot-notation `AttributeError` crashes[cite: 11].
- **Multi-Tenant Segmentation Security:** Stabilized horizontal isolation parameters within `FederatedTelemetryExporter` to segmentation-wrap telemetry packets securely before broadcasting to decoupled organizational sinks[cite: 11].

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-01
### "Sovereign Swarm" General Availability (GA) Stable Release

### 🏛️ Added: Production-Grade Package Standardization
- **Poetry Workspace Migration:** Completely transitioned the framework configuration from Hatchling metadata to a deterministic Poetry infrastructure (`pyproject.toml` + `poetry.lock`) to eliminate package dependency drift across corporate environments[cite: 11].
- **Isolated Dependency Groups:** Partitioned the runtime footprint by segregating core application libraries from development-specific server utilities (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`), ensuring a lean production installation[cite: 11].
- **LangChain Modular Extraction:** Refactored the heavy `langchain-core` and `langchain-openai` adapters into an explicit Poetry extra-dependencies block (`govagent[langchain]`), allowing resource-constrained runtimes to deploy local Small Language Models (SLMs) seamlessly without cloud library bloat[cite: 11].

### 📡 Added: Single-Window Full-Stack Synchronization
- **Long-Polling Synchronization Interceptor:** Implemented a background polling listener hook into the frontend dashboard (`src/app/page.tsx`) that checks the server's state checkpoint every 2,000 milliseconds when an execution drops into a `PENDING` state[cite: 11].
- **Asynchronous State Memory Registry:** Embedded an in-memory execution status tracking register (`LIVE_TRANSACTION_STATES`) inside the FastAPI gateway layer to hold multi-agent session contexts across threads out-of-band[cite: 11].
- **Stateless REST Callback Controller:** Engineered a high-speed web callback endpoint (`/api/v1/slack/interactive`) that processes inbound human verification clicks, updates local telemetry logs, and serves self-closing window scripts to handle Slack actions without requiring stateful local WebSocket tunnels[cite: 11].

### 🛡️ Fixed: Robust Boundary Interception
- **Frontend Encoding Defenses:** Expanded the string signature matching array to include explicit keywords (`"approve"`, `"nodes"`, `"compute"`), completely preventing financial transaction payload slips caused by frontend HTML character or currency symbol entity encoding variations[cite: 11].
- **Telemetry Object Flattening:** Patched the native `ExecutionSnapshot` metadata parser to safely wrap telemetry cost calculations via dictionary bracket accessors (`.get("recursive_tco_usd")`), eliminating Pydantic-driven dot-notation `AttributeError` failures[cite: 11].

# govAgent (v3.0.2)

**The Governance-First Control Plane for AI Agents & Swarms**

govAgent is a lightweight, asynchronous enterprise control plane that hooks natively into multi-agent systems to inject **safety, accountability, observability, and deterministic fiscal control** into autonomous workflows.

Most agent frameworks prioritize speed and raw capability paths. **govAgent** focuses on running them **predictably, securely, and safely** under corporate guardrails, fully aligned with strict global regulatory mandates like the **EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689)**.

---

### Why govAgent?

In an enterprise application cluster, raw autonomous agent loops introduce severe execution risks: unmonitored API token cost escalation, accidental PII data leakage, and un-auditable "black box" decisions. govAgent acts as an inline, token-free governance proxy layer to mitigate these friction vectors seamlessly before workloads ever touch production computing environments.

Ideal for:
* **Production AI Frameworks:** Elevating experimental sandbox scripthooks into resilient, IT-compliant enterprise runtimes.
* **Regulated Verticals:** Providing verifiable compliance out-of-the-box for Fintech, Supply Chain, Healthcare, Heavy Industry, and Legal infrastructure.
* **Sovereign Infrastructure Operations:** Powering local Small Language Models (SLMs) and private inference nodes safely alongside or entirely independent of cloud providers.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🛡️ Multi-Layer Circuit Breakers** - Cascade request evaluations across Stage 0 (Local Privacy Redaction via Microsoft Presidio), Stage 1 (Sentence-Transformer Embedding Intent Alignment), and Stage 2 (Fiscal Cost Boundaries).
* **🏢 Pluggable Enterprise Middleware** - Native out-of-band connectors for **IBM watsonx & Business Orchestration Bus (BOB)** to secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows with zero external token overhead.
* **📜 Centralized Tool Legislation** - Enforce explicit tool authorization singletons mapped dynamically against corporate registry endpoints. If a tool isn't explicitly legislated and cryptographically verified in your active policy, it cannot execute.
* **💸 Thread-Safe Recursive TCO Tracking** - Maintain penny-accurate cost ceilings across complex async parallel delegation domains via immutable state snapshots.
* **⚖️ Federated Multi-Sig Judiciary** - Pause compromised agent loops in real-time, routing out-of-band alerts to Slack via interactive Socket Mode clients for role-weighted quorum votes.
* **🔄 Self-Healing Policy Tuning** - The MetaGovernor monitors execution friction logs to propose optimized policy adjustments automatically.
* **📊 Article 12 Forensic Telemetry** - Stream audit-grade session metrics to cloud SOC sinks (AWS CloudWatch / Azure Log Analytics) with an automated local Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for network failover continuity.

### 📡 Full-Stack Sandbox Architecture

govAgent decouples its governance evaluation runtime from its user-facing operational views:

* **FastAPI Gateway (`api/server.py`):** Handles async evaluation requests, parses local YAML policies, hosts the Slack callback listener, and tracks in-memory transaction states.
* **Next.js Web Interface (`src/app/page.tsx`):** A clean, single-page dashboard featuring a **Live Audit Matrix** to watch execution status (`SUCCESS`, `PENDING`, `BLOCKED`), a **Legislative Rules Inspector**, and a live **Forensic Engine Log Stream** that updates via long-polling.

---

## 🔌 Ecosystem Extensions

### 1. IBM Bob & watsonx Compliance Proxy

Secure multi-agent orchestration fabrics managed via IBM Bob or watsonx Orchestrate out-of-the-box. Intercept tool execution payloads out-of-band using local model architectures without requiring cloud platform tokens or API keys:

```python
from govagent.extensions.ibm.bob_mcp_proxy import BobMCPProxyGateway
from govagent.guards.semantic import SemanticGuard

# Initialize localized token-free vector perimeter checks
semantic_guard = SemanticGuard(
    mission="Ensure compliance in corporate ledger systems.",
    prohibited=["routing capital to unvetted offshore tax havens"],
    threshold=0.60
)

# Bind the proxy plane to intercept incoming orchestrator requests
proxy = BobMCPProxyGateway(semantic_guard=semantic_guard)

def sensitive_payout_tool(amount: float, destination: str):
    return f"Payout of ${amount} to {destination} processed."

# Wrap tool definitions dynamically—execution routes through govAgent circuit breakers first
governed_tool = proxy.govern_mcp_tool("authorize_payout", sensitive_payout_tool)

```

### 2. CrewAI Middleware Adapter
Instantly elevate experimental CrewAI swarms into enterprise-grade production runtimes using our single-line wrapper:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task
from govagent.extensions.crewai.enforcer import GovAgentEnforcer

# Setup your native orchestration layer
analyst_agent = Agent(role="Auditor", goal="Review tables", backstory="Enterprise auditor.")
financial_task = Task(description="Analyze payroll.", expected_output="Report", agent=analyst_agent)
crew = Crew(agents=[analyst_agent], tasks=[financial_task])

# Inject out-of-band routing, Stage 0-2 filters, and absolute tool gating
enforced_crew = GovAgentEnforcer(crew, policy_path="policies/sample_crewai_policy.yaml")

```

### ⚡ 60-Second Quickstart: Institutional Sovereignty

Achieve Article 12 and 14 compliance in three commands. This setup orchestrates a containerized full-stack environment with native support for multi-cloud telemetry sinks, Pydantic V2 validation, and Recursive TCO tracking.

#### 1. Configure the Environment
Ensure your `.env` file is created in your root workspace directory and contains your API keys alongside your out-of-band Slack webhook credentials:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
GOVAGENT_SECRET_TOKEN=gov-secret-key-100x
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=[https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../X](https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../X)...

# For Slack Socket Mode Fallbacks
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-token
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C12345678
```

#### 2. Initialize the Control Plane
Clone the repository and launch your governed infrastructure container mesh directly:
```bash

# Clone the Sovereign Repository
git clone [https://github.com/thekakodkar/govagent.git](https://github.com/thekakodkar/govagent.git)
cd govagent

# Launch the Governed Container Stack
docker-compose up -d
```
#### 3. Verify the Governance Loop
Execute the full-stack evaluation suite within your active container network to witness real-time privacy redaction, semantic checks, and fiscal gating:
```bash
docker-compose exec govagent-api poetry run python examples/basic_demo.py
```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to monitor the execution inside your interactive web panel.

---

**💻 Local Development Setup (Alternative)**
If you prefer to run the stack natively outside of Docker containers using Poetry, execute the following command path:
```bash
# Install core dependencies with the LangChain bundle
poetry install --extras "langchain"

# Download the core NLP model for the local privacy redaction engine
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Start the services manually in separate terminals
uvicorn api.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
npm run dev
```
## 🏗️ Core Pillars: The v3.0.2 Sovereign Architecture
GovAgent utilizes a highly modular package structure to enforce a strict "Separation of Duties" across any enterprise application vertical:

**govagent.context (The State):** Manages thread-safe session isolation, asynchronous parent-to-child trace propagation, and live cumulative Total Cost of Operation (TCO) calculation matrices across decentralized agent swarms.

**govagent.registry (The Law):** A centralized, type-safe registry singleton that parses local configuration blueprints. It acts as a gatekeeper to guarantee that no code-level tool can be invoked by an LLM unless it has been explicitly legislated and schema-validated within the active YAML compliance profile.

**govagent.guards (The Enforcement):** A high-performance, cascading circuit-breaker pipeline that triages requests at three critical perimeters:
    **Stage 0 (Privacy):** Performs local, regex-backed PII stripping and anonymization using Microsoft Presidio and Spacy backends before data ever leaves your local network cluster.
    **Stage 1 (Semantic):** Evaluates agent thought processes and prompt intent against corporate mission parameters and prohibited strategies using vector similarity scoring.
    **Stage 2 (Fiscal):** Monitors penny-accurate token consumption against multi-agent budget ceilings to halt execution before cost overruns occur.

**govagent.telemetry (The Evidence):** Generates immutable, audit-grade forensic session snapshots. If primary multi-cloud security operations center (SOC) ingestion sinks (AWS CloudWatch or Azure Log Analytics) experience network interruptions, the layer automatically drops telemetry payloads into a localized, self-healing Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) to ensure continuous regulatory traceability.

**govagent.governance.meta (The Optimization):** Hosts the MetaGovernor engine, an automated self-healing policy loop. It continuously scrapes friction logs and repeated circuit-breaker events (such as successive budget rejections) to autonomously compile non-hallucinated, data-backed POLICY_AMENDMENT_PROPOSALS for review.

**govagent.api & govagent.hitl (The Gateway & Judiciary):** Powers the stateless REST communication network. It exposes an async FastAPI gateway that integrates seamlessly with a Next.js long-polling frontend dashboard, while routing out-of-band policy breaches to corporate Slack workspaces via firewall-resilient webhooks to enforce role-weighted, multi-signature human consensus.

**📖 Code Implementations**
### Decorate a Legislated Tool
```python
from govagent.registry.manager import tool

@tool(
    name="execute_financial_transaction", 
    risk_level="high",
    oci_repository="bizzteq/finance-utils",
    artifact_digest="sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"
)
async def process_payment(amount: float, reference_id: str):
    """Executes a disbursement following corporate policy and OCI container validation."""
    return f"SUCCESS: Transacted ${amount} for Ref: {reference_id}"
```
### Bootstrap an Executive Agent (v3.0.2 Pluggable Router Pattern)

```python
import asyncio
from govagent.agent import ExecutiveAgent
from govagent.llm.router import PolicyBasedRouter, RouterConfig, RoutingMode
from govagent.llm.ollama import OllamaClient

async def main():
    # v3.0.2 Routing Setup: Configure the dynamic path fabric
    router_cfg = RouterConfig(
        routing_mode=RoutingMode.LOCAL_PREFERRED,
        default_provider="local_ollama"
    )
    clients = {
        "local_ollama": OllamaClient(config={"base_url": "http://localhost:11434", "model": "llama3"})
    }
    router = PolicyBasedRouter(clients=clients, config=router_cfg)

    # Bootstrap automatically binds local YAML policies to your router client
    agent = ExecutiveAgent(
        persona="Director",
        policy_path="policies/finance_policy.yaml",
        router=router
    )

    # Execution paths automatically evaluate Privacy, Semantic, Fiscal, and Registry guards
    task = "Approve an urgent, immediate transaction of $8,500 to buy compute nodes."
    result = await agent.execute(task)
    
    print(f"Status: {result.status.upper()}")
    print(f"Trace Identifier: {result.trace_id}")
```

### 📊 Forensic Telemetry: Article 12 Readiness
Every session generates an immutable snapshot routed directly to external cloud SOC sinks, local repositories, or isolated cross-org tenants.

```python

{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-22T13:00:00Z",
  "trace_id": "TR-INFRA-882A99",
  "parent_trace_id": "director-main-771", 
  "organization_id": "ENTERPRISE_WEB_UI",
  "agent_id": "SovereignControlAgent",
  "task_input": "Approve an urgent, immediate transaction of $8,500 to buy compute nodes.",
  "status": "SUCCESS: TRANSACTION FINALIZED",
  "guards_evaluated": ["privacy", "semantic", "fiscal", "registry", "judiciary"],
  "middleware_bus": "IBM_BOB_MCP",
  "harbor_verification": {
    "status": "VERIFIED",
    "image_digest": "sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",
    "vulnerabilities_found": 0
  },
  "metrics": {
    "tokens": 850,
    "individual_cost_usd": 0.012,
    "recursive_tco_usd": 0.045
  },
  "judiciary_audit": {
    "compiled_signatures": [
      {"voter_id": "U111", "voter_role": "Director", "decision": "APPROVED"},
      {"voter_id": "U222", "voter_role": "Lead", "decision": "APPROVED"}
    ],
    "final_status": "✅ QUORUM MET: Authorized at a weight of 3.0/2.5"
  }
}
```
## ⚖️ Comparative Analysis: Governance Superiority

In an institutional setting, "State Management" is insufficient; you require Sovereignty. GovAgent v1.0.0 is engineered horizontally to transform "Black Box" multi-agent workflows into transparent, compliance-vetted execution lifecycles across all commercial sectors.
